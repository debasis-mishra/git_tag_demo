Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated.

A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change?—?it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.

Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags.
